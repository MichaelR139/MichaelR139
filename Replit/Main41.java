Let us consider the scenario regarding the born baby age

First Output: "Enter the age of the Child"
First Output: "Enter the age of the Child"
case 1: if age is 1 print as "You can Crawl"
case 1: if age is 1 print as "You can Crawl"
case 2 : if age is 2 print as  "You can Talk"
copied!
case 2 : if age is 2 print as  "You can Talk"
case 3: If age is 3 print as "You can Dance"
case 3: If age is 3 print as "You can Dance"
case 4: if age is 4 print as "You can get Trouble"
case 4: if age is 4 print as "You can get Trouble"
Other than this age (1-4) it should print "I don't know how old you are"
